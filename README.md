## Problem
This project aims to solve the following problem. Over time people are
interested where you live. When you move you have to let them know where to find
you. What if we could change that dependency?

So instead you keeping track who is interested where you live and being
responsible for updating their information, people who are interested in your
address get notified when you update it.

We aim to have a single source of truth that clients can get a part of, ensuring
that the are notified when changes are made.
